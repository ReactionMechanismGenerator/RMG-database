//f11 : insertion reaction (1,2-insertion) C.D.W. 01/29/03

// note from sumathy: the reason to get rid of CH2 and Oa :
// In F11, I have now removed CH2 and O insertion.  I am restricting myself
// to the CO insertion to C-H and C-C bond giving rise to "Aldehyde" and
// "Ketone" for this reaction family.  The other reactions seem not to be
// favourable. Especially with CH2T and Oat it is not possible. It has to be
// singlet. I now feel it is not necessary.
// note from nyee: I'm reinstating at least CH2(singlet) seeing as I have a paper with some of the rates. See rateLib for reference
