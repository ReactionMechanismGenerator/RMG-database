If a biradical CH2JJ can abstract from RCH4 to make RCH3J and CH3J 
then a Y_rad CH3J should be able to abstract from RCH3J which means X_H needs 
to include Xrad_H. I.e. you can abstract from a radical. To make this possible
a head node has been created X_H_or_Xrad_H which is a union of X_H and Xrad_H.
The kinetics for it have just been copied from X_H and are only defined for 
abstraction by Y_rad_birad. I.e. the top level very approximate guess.

Do better kinetics for this exist? Do we in fact use the reverse kinetics anyway?

Recommended value for C3H8+CH2OH-->n-C3H7+CH3OH comes from rate for C2H6+CH2OH-->C2H5+CH3OH

No discussion on where rate for C3H8+CH2OH-->i-C3H7+CH3OH comes from:

A is ~ factor of 3 smaller (6 hydrogens vs 2 ... seems reasonable to MRH)
E is 1 kcal/mol smaller (more stable to form secondary radical than primary)

Entry 46,5(f): No measurements on H-atom abstraction rxns. Recommended rate coefficient

is computed as follows:

The rate of O + C3H6 --> OH + H2C=CH-*CH2 is computed using the expression:
[k(O+C2H6-->C2H5+HO)/k(OH+C2H6-->C2H5+H2O)] * k(OH+C3H6-->H2C=CH-*CH2+H2O).
The author uses this expression because he notes that OH and O H-atom abstraction
rxns generally follow the same trend.  The O+C2H6, OH+C2H6, and OH+C3H6
are from other Tsang review articles.
The rate of O+C3H6 --> OH+CH3C=CH2 is computed by adjusting the O+C3H6 --> OH+H2C=CH-*CH2
rate coefficient: increasing the Ea/R by 880 Kelvin and multiplying the A
by ~0.345; these values come from the relative difference between the rxns

CBS-QB3 method was used to calculate electronic energy of reactants, products, and TS; frequencies were
calculated using B3LYP/CBSB7 method.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm: an asymmetric Eckart
tunneling correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomery et al.
J.Chem.Phys. 110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The external symmetry number for H2O2 was 2; the external symmetry number
for the remaining species and TS were set to 1.  The rate coefficient was computed at 600-2000K (in 200 K increments).
The computed pre-exponential factor was divided by 2 and this is the reported value.

JDM increased the activation energy for the abstraction of a vinyl-H hydrogen by O2.  August 2010.
Using the Evans-Polanyi principle with alpha = 1, the activation energy was increased by delta(vinyl radical - alkyl radical) = 9.6 kcal/mol.
Reaction rate 154 was the basis for this.

Previously, rates had been calculated by an averaging-of-averages technique, which resulted in the abstraction of vinyl-H's being orders of magnitude faster than the abstraction of alkyl-H's.

These rates have been calculated based on rates of primary- and secondary-alkyl H-abstractions by O2. 
The A-factors have remained the same.

CH2O + H2C=C[*CH2][CH3] = HCO + H2C=C[CH3]2

Geometries and energies of reactants, products, and TS were computed using the CBS-QB3 methodology; frequencies
were calculated at B3LYP/CBSB7.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm; an asymmetric Eckart tunneling
correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomergy et al.; J. Chem. Phys.
110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The Arrhenius fit was based on k(T) at T=600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000K.
The external symmetry number for CH2O and iso-butene was 2; the external symmetry for all others was 1.  The
electronic spin multiplicity was 1 for CH2O and iso-butene; the electronic spin multiplicity for all others was 2.
The computed pre-exponential factor was divided by 2 (symmetry of CH2O), from 6.13e-02 to 3.065e-02.

There are no rate coefficients for this reaction in the literature (based on MRH's limited search).
   Tsang {J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20 (1991) 221-273} recommends the following for the reaction of 
   CH2O + H2C=CH-*CH2 = HCO + H2C=CH-CH3: k(T) = 1.26e+08 * T^1.9 * exp(-18.184 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 25-85x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.
   
   The previous estimate by RMG for this reaction was: k(T) = 5.500e+03 * T^2.81 * exp(-5.86 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 80-13,000x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

ROH + .OO. --> HOO. + RO.

This rate coefficient is an estimate from W.H. Green (personal communication).  The pre-exponential factor has been
 divided by 2 (from 1e11 to 5e10), to account for the symmetry of .OO.  The temperature range is estimated as 300-2000 K
 and the rank is assigned 1, so that this rate coefficient estimate will be used in all instances.
This is simply an estimate; JDM and/or MRH will refine this value in the near future.
See also rate 532 for X_H + .OO. --> HOO. + X.

I have taken the estimated rate from 523, which assumes A=1e11 with Ea=enthothermicity,
and assigned it to the top level X_H node so that whenever .OO. is abstracting from 
something without a proper rate, this value is used instead of the lengthy average.

Rate Constants and Kinetic Isotope Effects on the Reaction of C2($X^1\Sigma_g^+$) with CH4 and CD4.
Akira Matsugi, Kohsuke Suma, and Akira Miyoshi

It was measured at pretty low temperatures (294-376), but also calculated ab initio. The calculated
rates are plotted but the expression is not reported.

    k = (10.0 +- 2.1)E-11 exp[-(4.4+-0.5 kJ mol)/RT] cm3 molecule-1 s-1
which gives 
    A = 6e13+-1.3e13 cm3/mole/s
    n = 0
    Ea = 1.05+-0.12  kcal/mol
The degeneracy of this reaction is 8 though, so per-site A is:
    A = 7.5e12+-1.6e12
    
(See also  doi:10.1063/1.3480395  for reactions of C2, but that may be the wrong electronic state.)

MHS computed rate coefficient using CBS-QB3 method, see _[MRHCBSQB3RRHO] for general algorithm
employed.  Two differences::
	1) the k(T) was calculated from 600 to 2000 K, in 200 K increments.
	2) Low-frequency torsional modes were treated as 1-d separable hindered rotors.  The scans
		were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.

MHS computed the fitted Arrhenius expression to be: k(T) = 6.99e-2 (T/1K)^3.75 exp(-10.89 kcal mol-1 / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
The pre-exponential was divided by 2 to get the per-H event.  The uncertainty in the E0
was estimated to be 2 kcal mol-1 (general accuracy of CBS-QB3 calculations) and the uncertainty
in the A parameter was MRH guess.

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: CH3CH2CH=CH2 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + CH3CHCH=CH2

This reaction was of interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to its kinetics
(in particular, the C4H8-1 predicted concentration for 10-atm JSR simulations between 800-1000 K).
The original mechanism had an estimate that was much faster than these new calculations (the RMG old
k(T) was 50-100x faster than these calculations between 800-1000 K).

MRH computed these kinetics using the CBS-QB3 method.  Hindered rotor corrections were accounted for in all species:
	CH3CH2CH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH2CH3 rotor
	OOCH3: -CH3 rotor
	TS: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor of react1, -CH3 and -OCH3 of react2, and -OOCH3 between react1 and react2
	HOOCH3: -CH3 and -OCH3 rotor
	CH3CHCH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor
External symmetry number of all speces was 1.  k(T) was computed from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals.  An
asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was used.

The computed k(T) was 1.482e-02 * (T/1K)^4.313 * exp(-8.016 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
MRH divided the pre-exponential by 2 to account for the reaction path degeneracy.

NOTE: Running PopulateReactions before and after this number produced results that differed by less than a factor
of three.  New numbers in the RMG database thus lead to an improvement in the RMG estimate (RMG works!).  Also,
this computed rate coefficient is a factor of 10 faster than Tsang's recommendation for C3H6 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + allyl;
his stated uncertainty is a factor of ten.  However, one would expect abstraction from the secondary carbon of
1-butane to be faster than the primary carbon of propene, because the C-H bond strength should be weaker.  So,
this calculation is in reasonable agreement with the literature.

MHS CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: *CH2-CH=CH2 + H2O2 = CH3-CH=CH2 + HO2

MHS computed rate coefficient using CBS-QB3 method, see _[MRHCBSQB3RRHO] for general algorithm
employed.  Two differences::
	1) the k(T) was calculated from 600 to 2000 K, in 200 K increments.
	2) Low-frequency torsional modes were treated as 1-d separable hindered rotors.  The scans
		were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.

MHS computed the fitted Arrhenius expression to be: k(T) = 3.51e-2 (T/1K)^4.22 exp(-9.86 kcal mol-1 / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
The pre-exponential was divided by 2 to get the per-H event.  The uncertainty in the E0
was estimated to be 2 kcal mol-1 (general accuracy of CBS-QB3 calculations) and the uncertainty
in the A parameter was MRH guess.

RMG previously estimated the kinetics of the titled reaction to be ~2 orders of magnitude faster
than calculations of MHS.

MHS CBS-QB3 calculations without 1d hindered rotor correction (due to presence of hydrogen bond interactions)
Exact reaction: HO2 + CH3-CH2-CH2-CH=O = H2O2 + CH3-CH2-CH2-C*=O

MHS computed rate coefficient using CBS-QB3 method, see _[MRHCBSQB3RRHO] for general algorithm
employed.  With the difference that the k(T) was calculated from 600 to 2000 K, in 200 K increments.

MHS computed the fitted Arrhenius expression to be: k(T) = 1.91e-4 (T/1K)^4.25 exp(-0.81 kcal mol-1 / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
The uncertainty in the E0 was estimated to be 2 kcal mol-1 (general accuracy of CBS-QB3 calculations) and the uncertainty
in the A parameter was MRH guess.

energy is that computed by the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The frequencies were computed with B3LYP/CBSB7.
In computing k(T), an asymmetric tunneling correction was employed, the calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.99, and the
