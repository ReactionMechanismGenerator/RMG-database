***high probability of inaccuracy***
Checked by Greg Magoon; I suspect the parameters in the paper come from a different reaction (maybe H + C2H2 -> products?); (even if it was the correct reaction, the parameters used by NIST and RMG appear to be based off of values from the abstract, but p. 1637 seems to suggest that it may be more complicated, perhaps a collision theory-type form as alluded to in the abstract...p. 1637 states "In calculating E1 allowance was made for the term T^1/2 appearing in the frequency factor.";if this is the case, then the NIST record is inaccurate; almost all the other papers in NIST database report 3rd order rate constant, which is proportional to [M]; the best assessment I have found is Stace and Murrell, IJCK, v. 10, p. 197-212, which seems to suggest bimolecular rate constant of at least ~10^14 at high pressure (over 3 orders of magnitude higher than this value); this paper and Troe, Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1978. 29: 223-250. make reference to "diffusion" limitations at very high pressure; another (relatively minor) consideration is that we will probably want to divide the reported rate coefficient by 2 to correctly account for stoichiometry

NIST Record: http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1988DUR/AMO636:10
Verified by Greg Magoon; RMG and NIST data seem to be the same; presumably, NIST fit is based off of data in Table 3, but the fit isn't quite right, especially at 1500 K ; using the 700 and 1300 table values, I get Ea=1.03 kcal/mol; using 1300 K value, I get A = 5.66E14 cm^3/mol-s; fit seems to be essentially indistinguishable from data at end points, and error is just under 10% at 1000 K...since the NIST fit has a slightly lower maximum error, I will just leave it the way it is; aside: 10^9.7 prefactor mentioned on p. 637 doesn't seem consistent with NIST data or paper data in Table III; this is presumably high-pressure limit since no pressure-dependence is indicated in the table

Chem. 96:2151–2161 (1992) DOI: 10.1021/j100184a025 (included as 172b, above), which, in turn, references [173] (Troe) paper...conditions for this paper are 1100 K - 1200 K
[173]: this contains the uncertainty estimate (see Table 2); I updated the DA uncertainty as I have done elsewhere; this seems to be the actual raw value that was subsequently interpreted/used in the paper cited by Ref. 172; conditions are 300 K and 1 bar, so apparently, the paper cited by Ref. 172 and/or Ref. 172 itself has assumed that it is in high-pressure limit and that it is temperature independent

Verified by Greg Magoon; NIST record has slightly different parameters than RMG (it doesn't seem like best-fit parameters are reported in the paper); paper values for k_inf with alpha = 1 appear in Tables 5/11 and values for alpha = 0.7 appear in Tables 6/12; NIST parameters agree within 10% of k_inf values in the paper with alpha = 1 A^-1 (Tables 11) (though in paper, they seem to suggest that alpha = 0.7 A^-1 (Table 6/12) matches experimental data better); I am assuming that their k is for the reaction, as written, so that no factor of two correction is needed; RMG parameters seem to agree with Table 5 values within 10% (agreement may not be quite as good as NIST fit, though it is not immediately obvious which fit is better without looking closer/doing calculations)

Verified by Greg Magoon; high-pressure rate constants are reported here; 
I don't immediately see an explicit temperature range for the polynomial fits, 
but the domain of the graphs agrees pretty well with the range in the rateLibrary 
(though the graphs seem to go slightly higher, to 2000 K); the abstract says 
"from room to combustion temperatures", so if anything, the range specified in 
the rateLibrary is probably too narrow; minor: I calculate 1.1E-9*6.022141E23=6.624E14, 
but rateLibrary has slightly different value of 6.64E14

Verified by Greg Magoon; value reported for k1a,Infinity (high-pressure) appears to be theoretical rather than experimentally based; value in paper is 7.7+/-1.0E13 (rateLibrary originally had 7.69E13 with uncertainty of *1.1, so I changed it to match paper values); there doesn't seem to be an experimental value for k1a, but k(1a+1b) is slightly lower (6.5E13); experimentally, they say no pressure dependence observed in studied pressure range (p. 326)

Verified by Greg Magoon; it is not immediately clear whether this rate constant is for high pressure limit, but based on other references to high pressure limit in the paper, I suspect that it is a high pressure limit value

Agreement with experimental data from Cobos et al. 
(C. J. Cobos, H. Hippler, and J. Troe, *J. Phys. Chem.* 89, 342, 1985)
was promising **at low pressures**, but 
"Significant deviations are observed between theory and experiment as the 
high-pressure limit is approached."
    
E.g., at 298 K

    "However, the value of 
    the high-pressure limit rate coefficient at 298.15 K for the
    termolecular process computed with TST, model I, and 
    model II does not agree with the estimated high-pressure 
    limit value of Cobos et al. at that temperature. TST, 
    model I, and model II agree with one another, predicting a 
    value of Log10(k)=-10.7 where the value of the limiting 
    high-pressure rate coefficient k=2E-11 cm3/molecule/s at 298.15 K, 
    while Cobos et al. estimate a value of Log10(k)=-10.12 
    (that is, k=7.5E-11 cm3/molecule/s)"

Rates measurement of **n-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.

C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site,
giving  (2.26±0.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radical–radical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E−11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * **n-butyl (0.75±0.14); (gives (2.26±0.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * s-butyl (1.66±0.22); (gives (5.00±0.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * t-butyl (2.34±0.39); (gives (7.05±1.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.8±1.8). (gives (8.43±5.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.

Lenhardt [143] measured (10.0±1.3)E12 cm3/mole/sec (at 300K, high pressure limit, from flash photolysis experiments.)
Atkinson [96], in their review, recommend 6.62E12 cm3/mole/sec. (according to Curran [8]).
Curran [8], in their modelling paper, refer to both these and chose and "intermediate" value of 7.54E12 cm3/mol/sec.

Curran [8] is the rate adopted here, giving 3.77E+12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by two to give the rate of addition per site.
The uncertainty of 1E12 cm3/mole/sec was estimated from these values

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured/estimated at 300K.

Rates measurement of **t-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.
C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site, 
giving  (7.05±1.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radical–radical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E−11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * n-butyl (0.75±0.14); (gives (2.26±0.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * s-butyl (1.66±0.22); (gives (5.00±0.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * **t-butyl (2.34±0.39); (gives (7.05±1.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.8±1.8). (gives (8.43±5.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.

MRH estimate

A reasonable estimate for the total k_inf(T) for the recombination of H radical with a heavy atom
is a temperature-independent 1e+14 cm3 mol-1 s-1.  HOWEVER, the value I choose to store in the database
is 1e+13 cm3 mol-1 s-1, because this is the single-event value.  Not knowing what species RMG will find
in trying this estimate, I want to fail on the low side.

Using a hydrogen on a primary carbon as an example: Ethane has a multiplicity of six, iso-butane has a
multiplicity of nine, and neo-pentane has a multiplicity of 12.  Using the 1e+13 cm3 mol-1 s-1 with any
of these multiplicities will not result in ridiculously fast kinetics.  The purpose of adding entries
491 and 492 are to reduce the chance RMG sends ridiculously fast high-P-limit kinetics to fame, thereby
giving us ridiculously fast k(T,P) in our chem.inp files and causing stiffness issues in flame solvers.

NOTE TO RMG USERS: If your model proves to be sensitive to the kinetics of the H+R(+M)=H-R(+M), I would
encourage you to run a fame job separately, with the 1e+14 cm3 mol-1 s-1 as the total k(T) (if no better
estimate is known).

MRH estimate

A reasonable estimate for the total k_inf(T) for the recombination of two heavy atom radicals is a
temperature-independent 1e+13 cm3 mol-1 s-1.  The actual high-P-limit k(T) sent to fame may be slightly
larger (e.g. neo-pentane has a multiplicity of four for breaking a C-CH3 bond) but this is still
reasonable.
