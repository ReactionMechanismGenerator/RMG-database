CBS-QB3 calculations (Catherina Wijaya). Treatment of hindered rotor included; hindered rotor PES are done at B3LYP/6-31g(d) level.

The rate was added by Sandeep Sharma on Feb 01 2006 (713a0f98f91) with message "I have added the rate rules given to me by Sumathy which are present in Pitz.xls file in the Acads directory of my laptop."
The node was commented out of the tree, disabling the rate, by Sandeep Sharma on Feb 13 2006 (2e7b38d367c9) with the message "Removed nodes Cs_H_out_H/(CCCOOH) and the others from under node Cs_H_out_H/NonDeC as it is not a subnode anyway."

On 6 April 2010, Josh Allen, Mike Harper and Richard West spent quite a while trying to put these nodes in the right place in the tree and to make the definitions valid and consistent.
Unfortunately it was not clear what they were intended to mean because many of the definitions overlap. We gave up, and they remain commented out.

Sumathy's CBS-QB3 calculations. Treatment of hindered rotor included; hindered rotor PES are done at B3LYP/6-31g(d') level.

The rate was added by Sandeep Sharma on Feb 01 2006 (713a0f98f91) with message "I have added the rate rules given to me by Sumathy which are present in Pitz.xls file in the Acads directory of my laptop."
The node was commented out of the tree, disabling the rate, by Sandeep Sharma on Feb 13 2006 (2e7b38d367c9) with the message "Removed nodes Cs_H_out_H/(CCCOOH) and the others from under node Cs_H_out_H/NonDeC as it is not a subnode anyway."

On 6 April 2010, Josh Allen, Mike Harper and Richard West spent quite a while trying to put these nodes in the right place in the tree and to make the definitions valid and consistent.
Unfortunately it was not clear what they were intended to mean because many of the definitions overlap. We gave up, and they remain commented out.

MHS CBS-QB3 calculations for CH3-CH2-CH=CH-O* == CH3-C*H-CH=CH-OH.  
Product is the cis configuration because TS is also cis.  
Note--this only affects the tunneling correction (b/c in products).  
Only methyl rotor was considered for TS.

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations with 1-d hindered rotor corrections for CH2=CH-CH2-OO => CH=CH-CH2-OOH

Previous RMG estimate for this reaction was an "Average of average" estimate.  This reaction was of
interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to allyl+O2 => C2H2+CH2O+OH.  The high-p
limit kinetics were necessary to estimate a k(T,P) for this PES.

Reactant: 2 hindered rotors were considered (the OO and CH2OO torsions)
TS: 0 hindered rotors were considered (MRH did not think 1-d separable rotor approximation was valid
	for cyclic TS)
Product: 3 hindered rotors were considered (the HO, HOO, and HOOCH2 torsions)

All external symmetry numbers were set equal to one.  The k(T) was calculated from 600 - 2000 K,
in 200 K intervals, and the fitted Arrhenius expression from CanTherm was:
k(T) = 2.468e+06 * (T/1K)^1.554 * exp(-26.636 kcal/mol / RT) cm3/mol/s.
The number appearing in the database has been divided by two to account for the reaction path degeneracy.
