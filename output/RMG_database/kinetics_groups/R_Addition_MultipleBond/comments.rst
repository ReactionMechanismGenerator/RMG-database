Verified by Greg Magoon; it is not immediately clear whether this rate constant is for high pressure limit, but based on other references to high pressure limit in the paper, I suspect that it is a high pressure limit value; also, note that CO_O group is used for H2CO...MRH and I have interpreted CO_O as referring to any carbonyl group

C2H2 + C2H3 --> CH2=CHCH=CH. (Rxn. -5?)

Verified by Greg Magoon: note: NIST seems to have values (http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1988DUR/AMO636:5 , which agree with RMG's original values) that are slightly diferent than this paper's values (p. 637); I can't seem to figure out where the NIST values are coming from (maybe Table 3?); therefore, I have changed rateLibrary to use paper parameters of 10^8.8 (/2) and 4.9 kcal/mol (these values seem to actually be taken from other publications, however), which I am assuming to be high-pressure values; also note that values from other sources are available in the NIST Kinetics Database

NIST Record: http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1988DUR/AMO636:4
Verified by Greg Magoon: it looks like value is taken from Rxn 18 of Table 3 (1E10), and is apparently non-pressure dependent (and non-temp dependent); based on the table, it looks like Ref. 42 in this paper may be the ultimate source of the value?
