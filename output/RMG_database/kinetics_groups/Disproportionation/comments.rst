Literature review: i-C3H7 + O2 = HO2 + C3H6

pg. 931-932: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 42,3 (a): Author appears to be skeptical of the only experimentally reported

value.  Author notes that more recent work on C2H5+O2 suggested that the
addition and disproportionation rxns may be coupled through a common intermediate.
For the time being, the author decided to recommend the only experimentally
reported rate coefficient, only for temperatures above 700K, as they note the
addition rxn should be the predominant rxn at lower temperatures.

Divide the rate constant by 12 to account for symmetry of 2 (O2) and 6 (i-C3H7, carbons #1 and 3).  The final result is 1.05833e+10 cm3/mol/s.

pg. 937: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 42,16 (b): Author notes that measurements performed by Arthur and Anastasi on

the rate coefficient of total CH3+i-C3H7 decomposition matches very well with
the coefficient derived from the recommended rate of CH3+CH3 decomposition, the 
recommended rate of i-C3H7+i-C3H7 decomposition, and the geometric rule.  The author
recommends a high-pressure rate expression of 4.7x10^-11*(300/T)^0.68 cm3/molecule/s
for the addition rexn (based on the geometric mean rule???) and recommends the 
branching ratio of 0.16 reported by Gibian and Corley (1973).
NOTE: Previous data entry appeared to compute A and n as such:

A = 0.16 * 4.7x10^-11 * (1/300)^0.68
n = 0.68
However, MRH would compute A and n:

A = 0.16 * 4.7x10^-11 * (300)^0.68
n = -0.68
These are the values that now reside in the database.  The online NIST database

(kinetics.nist.gov) agree with what I have calculated.

*** UPPER LIMIT ***

Entry 47,3(b): The author states that there is uncertainty whether this rxn is appreciable

at high temperatures.  There were conflicting results published regarding the
significance above 461K (Morgan et al. and Slagle and Gutman).  The author thus
decides to place an upper limit on the rate coefficient of 2x10^-12 * exp(-6820/T)
cm3/molecule/s.  The author further notes that this upper limit assumes no
contribution from a complex rearrangement of the adduct.  Finally, the author
notes that this rxn should not be significant in combustion situations.
MRH 31-Aug-2009

Divide the rate constant by 2 to account for symmetry of 2 (O2) and 1 (allyl, carbon #2). The final result is 6.022e+11 cm3/mol/s, Ea = 13.55 kcal/mol.

Literature review: CH3 + C3H5 --> H2C=C=CH2 + CH4

pg.257: Discussion on evaluated data

Entry 47,16(a): No data available at the time.  Recommended rate coefficient expression

based on rxn C3H5+C2H5=C2H4+C3H6 (James, D.G.L. and Troughton, G.E.); this leads to disproportionation-
to-addition ratio of 0.03.  The addition rate expression was derived using the geometric
mean rule for the rxns C3H5+C3H5-->adduct and CH3+CH3-->adduct.
NOTE: The Ea reported in the discussion is Ea/R=-132 Kelvin.  However, in the table near

the beginning of the review article (summarizing all reported data) and in the NIST
online database (kinetics.nist.gov), the reported Ea/R=-66 Kelvin.  MRH took the
geometric mean of the allyl combination rxn (1.70x10^-11 * exp(132/T)) and methyl
combination rxn (1.68x10^-9 * T^-0.64) to obtain 1.69x10^-11 * T^-0.32 * exp(66/T).
Multiplying by 0.03 results in the recommended rate coefficient expression.

(Essentially) Pressure-independent rate coefficient for CH3CHOH + O2 = HO2 + CH3CHO [Zador2009]_.

Authors computed the following PES:
	Entrance channel: CH3CHOH+O2
	Product channels: CH3CHO+HO2, CH2CHOH+HO2, 2-oxiranol+OH
	Wells: CH3CH(OO)OH, CH3CH(OOH)O, CH2CH(OOH)OH, CH3CHO--HO2 (hydrogen-bonding)
Geometry optimizations and IRC scans were done using B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p).  Single-point energies were computed using
 RQCISD(T)/cc-pV(INF)Z.  For stationary points with large T1 diagnostics, CASPT2 and MRCI with Davidson corrections
 were employed.
The rate coefficients were computed using RRKM/ME techniques developed by Miller and Klippenstein.  Low-frequency
 torsional modes were treated as hindered rotors using Pitzer-Gwinn; the scan was performed at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) and fit
 to a Fourier series.  An asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was employed.  A simple exponential-down model was used,
 where <delta_Ed> = 100 * (T/298) cm-1.  Lennard-Jones parameters for the C2H5O3 isomers were assumed to be sigma = 4.31 Angstroms
 and epsilon/kB = 297 K.
The authors solved the PES using VRC-TST, with the following exceptions, in Variflex:
	- The TS between CH3CH(OO)OH and CH3CHO--HO2 was treated as the product channel CH3CHO+HO2
	- The CH3CHO--HO2 well, and its TS to the product channel CH3CHO+HO2, were not included
	- The CH3CH(OOH)O well, and its TS to the well CH3CH(OO)OH, were not included
The authors calculated k1,zero (collisionless) and k1,inf (high-pressure-limit) over the range 250-1000 K.
 The two rate coefficients were similar over most of the temperature range, suggesting a pressure-independent rate
 coefficient is adequate.  The value reported in RMG is the high-pressure limit.
The authors conclude that the CH3CHO+HO2 product channel dominates at all temperatures and pressures.  Hence, the
 entire computed k1,inf is assigned to the reaction CH3CHOH+O2=HO2+CH3CHO.  Furthermore, the authors detected a strong
 signal from the m/z = 44 PIE scan; they concluded this was due to the CH3CHO and CH2CHOH isomers.
This rate coefficient recommendation is up to 3x slower than the previous RMG-employed recommendation, over the valid
 temperature range.
