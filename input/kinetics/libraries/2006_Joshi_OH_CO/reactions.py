Chebyshev fit to T,P-dependent k's calculated with CCSD(T)/cc-pvTZ for the small OH + CO surface by:
A.V. Joshi and H. Wang,
"Master equation modeling of wide range temperature and pressure dependence of CO + OH -> Products'
Int. J. Chem. Kin., Vol. 38, Iss. 1, January 2006, Pages 57-73
The surface includes OH+CO, HOCO and H+CO2 only.
Calculated for an N2/Ar bath gas
