***high probability of inaccuracy***
Checked by Greg Magoon; I suspect the parameters in the paper come from a different reaction (maybe H + C2H2 -> products?); (even if it was the correct reaction, the parameters used by NIST and RMG appear to be based off of values from the abstract, but p. 1637 seems to suggest that it may be more complicated, perhaps a collision theory-type form as alluded to in the abstract...p. 1637 states "In calculating E1 allowance was made for the term T^1/2 appearing in the frequency factor.";if this is the case, then the NIST record is inaccurate; almost all the other papers in NIST database report 3rd order rate constant, which is proportional to [M]; the best assessment I have found is Stace and Murrell, IJCK, v. 10, p. 197-212, which seems to suggest bimolecular rate constant of at least ~10^14 at high pressure (over 3 orders of magnitude higher than this value); this paper and Troe, Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1978. 29: 223-250. make reference to "diffusion" limitations at very high pressure; another (relatively minor) consideration is that we will probably want to divide the reported rate coefficient by 2 to correctly account for stoichiometry

NOTE: Data entry was not consistent w/recommended value in reference (pg. 36)

MRH computes A=4.88E+15, n=-1, E=0, dA=*2.0 (11Aug2009)

MRH interprets data in reference as 2.7E-11*(300/T)^-1, NOT 2.7E-11*exp(300/T)

NOTE: kinetics.nist.gov has 2.7E-11*exp(300/T) expression in database

kinetics.nist.gov also has A/n/E from 2006 paper by Klippenstein et al.;
the new rate expression matches Klippenstein's value better across the valid T range

Entry 44,16(b)

MRH computed geometric mean of CH3+CH3-->adduct (1.68x10^-9 * T^-0.64) and tC4H9+tC4H9-->adduct

(4x10^-12 * (300/T)^1.5) to obtain: 5.909x10^-9 * T^-1.07.  Setting the temperature
exponent equal to one and multiplying by 1 (*300/300) results in: 1.970x10^-11 * (300/T)
which is somewhat in agreement with the value recommended by Tsang.

Curran's estimation in DME modeling for ketohydroperoxide decomposition 

Apparently the number comes from estimate for reverse of Rxn. 337: HO2CH2OCHO -> .OCH2OCHO + .OH (2E13) (p. 234); reverse of Rxn. 191 (p. 238) would also be informative, but it doesn't seem to be disucussed in paper
Verified by Greg Magoon; it is not immediately clear whether this rate constant is for high pressure limit, but based on other references to high pressure limit in the paper, I suspect that it is a high pressure limit value

RRK(M) extrapolation. H + O2 --> OH + O

C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition per site.

Agreement with experimental data from Cobos et al. 
(C. J. Cobos, H. Hippler, and J. Troe, *J. Phys. Chem.* 89, 342, 1985)
was promising **at low pressures**, but 
"Significant deviations are observed between theory and experiment as the 
high-pressure limit is approached."
    
E.g., at 298 K

    "However, the value of 
    the high-pressure limit rate coefficient at 298.15 K for the
    termolecular process computed with TST, model I, and 
    model II does not agree with the estimated high-pressure 
    limit value of Cobos et al. at that temperature. TST, 
    model I, and model II agree with one another, predicting a 
    value of Log10(k)=-10.7 where the value of the limiting 
    high-pressure rate coefficient k=2E-11 cm3/molecule/s at 298.15 K, 
    while Cobos et al. estimate a value of Log10(k)=-10.12 
    (that is, k=7.5E-11 cm3/molecule/s)"
    
The calculations used the *ab initio* PES of Walch et al., which was the best available in 1991.

Rates measurement of **n-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.

C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site,
giving  (2.260.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radicalradical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * **n-butyl (0.750.14); (gives (2.260.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * s-butyl (1.660.22); (gives (5.000.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * t-butyl (2.340.39); (gives (7.051.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.81.8). (gives (8.435.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.
