NIST record: http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1950DIN/LER1632-1637:1
***high probability of inaccuracy***
Checked by Greg Magoon; I suspect the parameters in the paper come from a different reaction (maybe H + C2H2 -> products?); (even if it was the correct reaction, the parameters used by NIST and RMG appear to be based off of values from the abstract, but p. 1637 seems to suggest that it may be more complicated, perhaps a collision theory-type form as alluded to in the abstract...p. 1637 states "In calculating E1 allowance was made for the term T^1/2 appearing in the frequency factor.";if this is the case, then the NIST record is inaccurate; almost all the other papers in NIST database report 3rd order rate constant, which is proportional to [M]; the best assessment I have found is Stace and Murrell, IJCK, v. 10, p. 197-212, which seems to suggest bimolecular rate constant of at least ~10^14 at high pressure (over 3 orders of magnitude higher than this value); this paper and Troe, Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1978. 29: 223-250. make reference to "diffusion" limitations at very high pressure; another (relatively minor) consideration is that we will probably want to divide the reported rate coefficient by 2 to correctly account for stoichiometry

Verified by Greg Magoon; three A factors have been reported (for 3 different densities); the value currently used in the rateLibrary appears to come from the middle density: 5E-5 (mol/cm^3, I think);I have assumed that the 2nd two columns in Table II are for the reverse reaction reference for this value is apparently in Japanese (see *** note in Table 2); minor issue: I calculate -19/4.184 = -4.54 kcal/mol (vs. -4.53 in rateLibrary)

NIST record: http://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1998PES/PIL8526-8536:1
Verified by Greg Magoon; NIST record has slightly different parameters than RMG (it doesn't seem like best-fit parameters are reported in the paper); paper values for k_inf with alpha = 1 appear in Tables 5/11 and values for alpha = 0.7 appear in Tables 6/12; NIST parameters agree within 10% of k_inf values in the paper with alpha = 1 A^-1 (Tables 11) (though in paper, they seem to suggest that alpha = 0.7 A^-1 (Table 6/12) matches experimental data better); I am assuming that their k is for the reaction, as written, so that no factor of two correction is needed; RMG parameters seem to agree with Table 5 values within 10% (agreement may not be quite as good as NIST fit, though it is not immediately obvious which fit is better without looking closer/doing calculations)

CH3 + iso-C3H7 --> iso-C4H10 

Verified by Greg Magoon; high-pressure rate constants are reported here; 
I don't immediately see an explicit temperature range for the polynomial fits, 
but the domain of the graphs agrees pretty well with the range in the rateLibrary 
(though the graphs seem to go slightly higher, to 2000 K); the abstract says 
"from room to combustion temperatures", so if anything, the range specified in 
the rateLibrary is probably too narrow; minor: I calculate 1.1E-9*6.022141E23=6.624E14, 
but rateLibrary has slightly different value of 6.64E14

NOTE: Data entry was not consistent w/recommended value in reference (pg. 36)

MRH computes A=4.88E+15, n=-1, E=0, dA=*2.0 (11Aug2009)

MRH interprets data in reference as 2.7E-11*(300/T)^-1, NOT 2.7E-11*exp(300/T)

NOTE: kinetics.nist.gov has 2.7E-11*exp(300/T) expression in database

kinetics.nist.gov also has A/n/E from 2006 paper by Klippenstein et al.;
the new rate expression matches Klippenstein's value better across the valid T range

MRH computed geometric mean of CH3+CH3-->adduct (1.68x10^-9 * T^-0.64) and tC4H9+tC4H9-->adduct

(4x10^-12 * (300/T)^1.5) to obtain: 5.909x10^-9 * T^-1.07.  Setting the temperature
exponent equal to one and multiplying by 1 (*300/300) results in: 1.970x10^-11 * (300/T)

C2H5 + OH (+M) --> C2H5OH (+M) (Rxn. 1a)

Verified by Greg Magoon; value reported for k1a,Infinity (high-pressure) appears to be theoretical rather than experimentally based; value in paper is 7.7+/-1.0E13 (rateLibrary originally had 7.69E13 with uncertainty of *1.1, so I changed it to match paper values); there doesn't seem to be an experimental value for k1a, but k(1a+1b) is slightly lower (6.5E13); experimentally, they say no pressure dependence observed in studied pressure range (p. 326)

Curran's estimation in DME modeling for ketohydroperoxide decomposition 

Apparently the number comes from estimate for reverse of Rxn. 337: HO2CH2OCHO -> .OCH2OCHO + .OH (2E13) (p. 234); reverse of Rxn. 191 (p. 238) would also be informative, but it doesn't seem to be disucussed in paper
Verified by Greg Magoon; it is not immediately clear whether this rate constant is for high pressure limit, but based on other references to high pressure limit in the paper, I suspect that it is a high pressure limit value

Agreement with experimental data from Cobos et al. 
(C. J. Cobos, H. Hippler, and J. Troe, *J. Phys. Chem.* 89, 342, 1985)
was promising **at low pressures**, but 
"Significant deviations are observed between theory and experiment as the 
high-pressure limit is approached."
    
E.g., at 298 K

    "However, the value of 
    the high-pressure limit rate coefficient at 298.15 K for the
    termolecular process computed with TST, model I, and 
    model II does not agree with the estimated high-pressure 
    limit value of Cobos et al. at that temperature. TST, 
    model I, and model II agree with one another, predicting a 
    value of Log10(k)=-10.7 where the value of the limiting 
    high-pressure rate coefficient k=2E-11 cm3/molecule/s at 298.15 K, 
    while Cobos et al. estimate a value of Log10(k)=-10.12 
    (that is, k=7.5E-11 cm3/molecule/s)"
    
The calculations used the *ab initio* PES of Walch et al., which was the best available in 1991.

Many extensions and improvements are suggested for future work, which may well 
have happened since the paper was published in 1996. Revision of this rate is recommended.

We are using a primary R. radical as a methyl radical. The rate comes from n-butyl.

Rates measurement of **n-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.

C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site,
giving  (2.260.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radicalradical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * **n-butyl (0.750.14); (gives (2.260.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * s-butyl (1.660.22); (gives (5.000.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * t-butyl (2.340.39); (gives (7.051.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.81.8). (gives (8.435.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.

Atkinson [96], in their review, recommend 6.62E12 cm3/mole/sec. (according to Curran [8]).
Curran [8], in their modelling paper, refer to both these and chose and "intermediate" value of 7.54E12 cm3/mol/sec.

Curran [8] is the rate adopted here, giving 3.77E+12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by two to give the rate of addition per site.

In their study modelling iso-octane oxidation, Curran et al [8] chose to use the rate measured by Lenhardt et al [143] described below.

[143] Lenhardt, T.M.; McDade, C.E.; Bayes, K.D.; *J. Chem. Phys.* 1980, 72,304 http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.438848

Rates measurement of **t-butyl** + O2 at 300 K. High pressure limit from flash photolysis experiments.
C.D.W. divided rate expression by 2, to get rate of addition rate per site, 
giving  (7.051.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec.

    Rate constants for the reaction of four different butyl radicals with molecular oxygen 
    have been measured **at room temperature**. The radicals were generated by flash photolysis 
    and their time decay was followed with a photoionization mass spectrometer. The radical 
    concentrations were kept low to avoid complications from radicalradical reactions. 
    Radical lifetimes were long, up to 50 msec, thus assuring that thermalized radicals were being studied. 
    
    The rate constants, in units of 10E11 cm3/molecule/sec, are:
    
     * n-butyl (0.750.14); (gives (2.260.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * s-butyl (1.660.22); (gives (5.000.66)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     * **t-butyl (2.340.39); (gives (7.051.17)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)**
     * 3-hydroxy s-butyl (2.81.8). (gives (8.435.42)E12 cm3/mole/sec when divided by 2 to get rate per site)
     
    No pressure dependence of the rate constants was observed over the range 1 to 4 Torr. 

Because radical addition to a double bond is probably barrierless, the temperature range 300-1500K
has been assigned although the rate was only measured at 300K.
