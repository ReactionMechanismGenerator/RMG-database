The geometries of all reactants, products, and the transition state were optimized using the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The zero-point
energy is that computed by the CBS-QB3 calculations.  The frequencies were computed with B3LYP/CBSB7.
In computing k(T), an asymmetric tunneling correction was employed, the calculated frequencies were scaled by 0.99, and the 
temperatures used were: 300, 331, 370, 419, 482, 568, 692, 885, 1227, 2000 (evenly spaced on inverse temperature scale).
