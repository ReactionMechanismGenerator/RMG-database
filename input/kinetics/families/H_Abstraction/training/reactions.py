CBS-QB3 method was used to calculate electronic energy of reactants, products, and TS; frequencies were

tunneling correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomery et al.

CH2O + H2C=C[*CH2][CH3] = HCO + H2C=C[CH3]2

Geometries and energies of reactants, products, and TS were computed using the CBS-QB3 methodology; frequencies
were calculated at B3LYP/CBSB7.  Arrhenius expression was computed using CanTherm; an asymmetric Eckart tunneling
correction was employed and the frequencies were scaled by 0.99 (as suggested by Montgomergy et al.; J. Chem. Phys.
110 (1999) 2822-2827).  The Arrhenius fit was based on k(T) at T=600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2000K.
The external symmetry number for CH2O and iso-butene was 2; the external symmetry for all others was 1.  The
electronic spin multiplicity was 1 for CH2O and iso-butene; the electronic spin multiplicity for all others was 2.

There are no rate coefficients for this reaction in the literature (based on MRH's limited search).
   Tsang {J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 20 (1991) 221-273} recommends the following for the reaction of 
   CH2O + H2C=CH-*CH2 = HCO + H2C=CH-CH3: k(T) = 1.26e+08 * T^1.9 * exp(-18.184 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 25-85x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.
   
   The previous estimate by RMG for this reaction was: k(T) = 5.500e+03 * T^2.81 * exp(-5.86 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.
   This rate coefficient is 80-13,000x faster than MRH's calculation over the range 600-2000K.

MRH CBS-QB3 calculations w/1d hindered rotor corrections
Exact reaction: CH3CH2CH=CH2 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + CH3CHCH=CH2

This reaction was of interest to MRH/MHS because the butanol model was sensitive to its kinetics
(in particular, the C4H8-1 predicted concentration for 10-atm JSR simulations between 800-1000 K).
The original mechanism had an estimate that was much faster than these new calculations (the RMG old
k(T) was 50-100x faster than these calculations between 800-1000 K).

MRH computed these kinetics using the CBS-QB3 method.  Hindered rotor corrections were accounted for in all species:
    CH3CH2CH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH2CH3 rotor
    OOCH3: -CH3 rotor
    TS: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor of react1, -CH3 and -OCH3 of react2, and -OOCH3 between react1 and react2
    HOOCH3: -CH3 and -OCH3 rotor
    CH3CHCH=CH2: -CH3 and -CH=CH2 rotor
External symmetry number of all speces was 1.  k(T) was computed from 600 - 2000 K, in 200 K intervals.  An
asymmetric Eckart tunneling correction was used.

The computed k(T) was 1.482e-02 * (T/1K)^4.313 * exp(-8.016 kcal/mol / RT) cm3 mol-1 s-1.

NOTE: Running PopulateReactions before and after this number produced results that differed by less than a factor
of three.  New numbers in the RMG database thus lead to an improvement in the RMG estimate (RMG works!).  Also,
this computed rate coefficient is a factor of 10 faster than Tsang's recommendation for C3H6 + OOCH3 = HOOCH3 + allyl;
his stated uncertainty is a factor of ten.  However, one would expect abstraction from the secondary carbon of
1-butane to be faster than the primary carbon of propene, because the C-H bond strength should be weaker.  So,
this calculation is in reasonable agreement with the literature.

G3 PES calculations using Variflex including tunneling corrections.

High-pressure limit rate constants of the title reactions have been calculated in the temperature range

transition state theory (VRC-TST) has been used for the rate constants of the barrier-less entrance channel.
