CF2 + CH3 -> CF2CH3 -> CF2=CH2 + H

PES calculated at the G3 level of theory
The authors investigated the potential energy surface for the reaction via both density functional and MP2 methods. 
They conclude that CF2CH3 is formed as an intermediate but undergoes essentially no stabilization 
under the reported conditions. We will make the intermediate CF2CH3 and let RMG decide via the PDEP module whether or not
to skip the well

We are using rate for CF2 + OH -> CF2O + H
For the CF2 + OH reaction, the CF2O + H product channel is highly exothermic 
(55.0 kcal/mol at the QCISD(T)/CBS level). With such a large exothermicity there 
should be essentially no collisional stabilization of the CF2OH complex 
(69.4 kcal/mol exothermic) except perhaps at very low temperature and extraordinarily high pressures.

We will let the RMG PDEP module skip the CF2OH intermediate
